# Infix-Postfix-Prefix-Conversion-Visualizer  
The way to write arithmetic expressions is known as a notation. An arithmetic expression can be written in three different but equivalent notations, i.e. without changing the output of an expression. These notations are - Infix, Postfix and Prefix. These notations are named as how they use operators in expressions.  
This project visualizes the conversions between these notions.
